1) Install Microsoft Windows 10 and Server 2016 (or whatever version you want to use) within Microsoft Azure cloud software.
2) When installing the server, be sure to find a size that will support 2 NICs (I used D2 v5).
3) Create a secondary Network Interface Card (NIC) on the Server 2016 machine.
      Shut down the server VM
      Go to your server VM, down to Networking
      Attach Network Interface, name it whatever you want
      Restart the server VM
4) In the server VM, go to:
      Network Settings -> Change Adapter Settings
      Find the internal NIC and rename it to something like "Internal"
      Restart
5) Go back to network settings to set IP address for internal NIC
      Network Settings -> Change Adapter Options
      Double-Click Internet Protocol Version 4
      Select "Use the following IP address"
      IP: 172.16.0.1
      Subnet: 255.255.255.0
      Prefered DNS Server: 127.0.0.1 (Loopback IP)
6) Install Active Directory Domain Services:
      In the Server Manager main page, click "Add Roles and Features"
      Select "Role-based or Feature-based installation"
      Select the server you wish to install Active Directory Domain Services (I only had 1 option)
      Check "Active Directory Domain Services" click next
      Keep pre-set "Features"... next
      AD DS... next
      Install
7) Post-Deployment Configuration
      Click "Promote this computer to Domain Server
      Cick "Add new forest"
      Name it whatever you want (I chose "mydomain.com")
      Create a password, you won't use it anyway
      Do NOT check anything under DNS Options... next
      Additional Options... next
      Paths... next
      Review Options... next
      Install
